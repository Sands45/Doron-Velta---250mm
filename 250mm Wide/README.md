A modification of the original. Main change are 250mm long 2024 side rails (vs 235mm stock).
This adds a modest amout of printable bed space (about 9mm in diameter) and removes cuts from "stock" 250mm long 2040 extrusions.

Additional Changes:
* Two motors moved to the lower compartment for more room for a control. Also move mass to the bottom from the top.
* LED strip for chamber lights, VHBed in
* Access cut on the side of the motor mounts for more convenient wire routing.
* 250mm Changes
  * Side skirts modified to accomodate the longer side rails
  * Larger clear panels for chamber.
  * Upper, lower, top and bottom panel designs to fit the 250mm rails. (Top is inset for a cleaner finish).
  * Bed mounts tweeked to fit the bed with the larger perimeter.
* Skirts
  * Fan mount added to skirts.
  * Front display mount for a Mini 12864
  * Neopixel LED holder for the Voron logos in the skirts
  * Filtered power input skirt
  * There are enough skirt parts to configure them how you'd like. Fan, no fan, display, no display, etc.
* Upper and lower corners opened up a bit for easier wire routing
* New mount for the power supply
* PG7 gland nut location for wires to the toolhead in the "ceiling".
* M4 extruder mount
* Voron exhaust and side filament inlet

A modification of the original. Main change are 250mm long 2040 side rails (vs 235mm stock).
This adds a modest amout of printable bed space (about 9mm in diameter) and removes cuts from "stock" 250mm long 2040 extrusions.

**Additional Changes:**
* Two motors moved to the lower compartment for more room for a control. Also move mass to the bottom from the top.

* Access cut on the side of the motor mounts for more convenient wire routing.

**250mm Changes**
  * Side skirts modified to accomodate the longer side rails
  * Larger clear panels for chamber.
  * Upper, lower, top and bottom panel designs to fit the 250mm rails. (Top is inset for a cleaner finish - IMHO - user preference though).
  * Bed mounts tweeked to fit the bed with the larger perimeter.
